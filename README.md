Using the Nelson State Cinema’s ticket prices, how can we build test cases to run unit tests to validate the functions in the cinema’s application? As a start, we were given 9 functions that were built in C# for the cinema’s app. The challenge here is to build test cases that can automate the testing in NUnit. 
NUnit is an open-source unit testing framework that enable us to build test cases, test suits and assertions in C#. Using NUnit, I’ve built 5 cases each for the 9 functions which comes up to 45 test cases in total in this challenge.

# How to run
1. Clone this repo 

2. Refer to this tutorial on how to setup NUnit. This solution should be similar.

3. Open the solution CinemaCSApp->CinemaCSApp.sln

4. You should have 2 projects in your solution. CinemaCSApp is the application project and CinemaCSApp_Test is the unit test project. 
    Make sure you have some prerequisites install on your Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition):

        - The test project should have these NuGet Packages installed
            - Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk
            - NUnit
            - NUnit3TestAdapter

5. Test->Test Explorer. Run all Tests
